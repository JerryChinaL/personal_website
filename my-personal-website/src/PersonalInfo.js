            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Jerry Liu, a third-year student at the University of Chicago, majoring in Computer Science, Math, and Statistics. I have a passion for software development, data science, artificial intelligence, and research. Some of my interests include rock climbing, hiking, poker, eating sushi, and watching movies. I enjoy doing new things to challenge myself and get excited, but also enjoy staying being comfortable in my lifestyle (besides going to the Gym). I like exploring a little bit of fashion, and shopping new tech.</p>
